<h3>Catalogue of all X-tee subsystems with methods and WSDL descriptions</h3>
<p>This catalogue is generated by making getWsdl requests from RIA's Monitoring Security Server
  to all X-tee subsystems.</p>
<p>Subsystems with the <span class="badge badge-secondary">Empty</span> icon have no X-Tee
  services available.</p>
<p>Subsystems with the <span class="badge badge-danger">Error</span> icon either could not be
  reached by RIA's Monitoring Security Server or there was some other error during the request.</p>
